> **Say hello to your terminal — and it finally answers.**

## What is `hello`?

`hello` is the tiniest conversation-starter for your command line.  
Type `hello`, hit ⏎, and the shell greets you back with the classic `Hello, world!`

Nothing to configure, nothing to install at runtime—just a single, static,
≈ 1 MiB executable that proves your terminal is alive (and friendly).

## Why bother?

* On a fresh Windows box, `hello` used to be a dead end—**now it talks**.  
* The quickest smoke-test for a new shell, VM, container or CI runner.  
* Living "Hello, world!" demo that shows **Go + GoReleaser + winget** in action.  
* It makes you smile.  Sometimes that's enough.

## Why Go?

| Aspect | Go (this project) | Rust | .NET AOT | C / C++ | Node (pkg) |
|--------|-------------------|------|----------|---------|------------|
| Single binary | ✔ | toolchain tweaks | 5 – 6 MiB | manual | 60 MiB |
| Cross-compile | one env var | complex | limited | per-SDK | gaps |
| Build system | **GoReleaser** | cargo-release | MSBuild | none | manual |
| Learning curve | 15 min | steep | medium | memory mgmt | easiest |
| AV false alarms | low | medium | lowest | medium | medium |

Go hits the sweet spot of **tiny output, trivial cross-compile and fast iteration**,
with an ecosystem tailor-made for CLI shipping.
